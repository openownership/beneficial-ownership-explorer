    "en": "Unified Social Credit Identifiers (USCIs) are used for businesses and other entities in China as a general tax identification number (TIN), but the online registry mentioned here only shows non-domestic NGOs. There is also a website for businesses (http://gsxt.gov.cn) but you will need to know the organisation’s name in Chinese to find the USCI. NGOs and businesses should be able to provide their USCI easily. NGOs have to have their registration checked and reconfirmed every year in accordance with the Overseas NGO Management Law which came into effect in January 2017."
