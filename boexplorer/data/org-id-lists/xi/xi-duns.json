    "en": "The D-U-N-S Number is a unique nine-digit number that identifies organizations on a location-specific basis. Companies, charities, and government agencies can all receive a D-U-N-S Number [1][2].\n\nDun & Bradstreet (D&B) assigns and maintains D-U-N-S Numbers. The process for requesting a D-U-N-S Number varies by country, but organizations can typically request a D-U-N-S Number via the D&B website for their country. In the UK and Ireland, all registered businesses are automatically issued with a D-U-N-S Number [3][4].\n\nD-U-N-S Numbers are location-specific so one legal entity may have many associated D-U-N-S Numbers, one for each business location [2].\n\n[1] https://www.dnb.co.uk/duns-number.html\n[2] https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/\n[3] https://www.dnb.com/solutions/government/duns-number-request-guide.html\n[4] https://www.dnb.co.uk/duns-number/lookup/request-a-duns-number.html"
