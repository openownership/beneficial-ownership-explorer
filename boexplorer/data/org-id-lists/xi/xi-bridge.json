    "en": "As of August 2020 the BRIDGE project has been shut down. It was led by four nonprofit partners – GlobalGiving, TechSoup Global, GuideStar, and Foundation Center – BRIDGE assigned a unique identification number, known as a BRIDGE number, to individual social sector entities around the world. Each 10-digit BRIDGE number was randomly generated and unique to an organization.\n\n**The legal form or organizations that the list covers**: BRIDGE covered a variety of entities. Any private organization or program anywhere in the world devoted to social good could be assigned a BRIDGE number. The historical data archives of BRIDGE are no longer maintained or updated, but can be accessed at https://www.bridge-registry.org/data/index.html.\n\n"
