NGOs are then issued with a certificate that contains their registration number. \n\nThere is no database available for search.\n\n\"The Social Welfare Department is the regulator of NGOs in Ghana and is therefore mandated to issue certificates of recognition to organizations to operate as NGOs. \" [1]\n\n[1] http://g-lishfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/HOW-TO-START-AN-NGO-IN-GHANA.pdf"
