Registration with the PCP is not obligatory for working in Pakistan and therefore not all NGOs will be recorded on the 'PCP Certified CSO List'. However, this list can be searched online.\n\nAll NGOs are required to register with their local Voluntary Social Welfare department. \n\n\"This voluntary assessment aims to enhance a CSOs' credibility and resultantly its access to funding. Through the allied activities of this programme, PCP promotes certified CSOs in an annual directory and on its website and also builds capacities of civil society organisations for greater effectiveness.\" [1]\n\n[1] http://pcp.org.pk/page.php?pid=19"
