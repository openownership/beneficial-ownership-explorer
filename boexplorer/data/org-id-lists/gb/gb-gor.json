It contained an identifier for every government body with a presence on the gov.uk single domain.\n\nThis covered government departments, agencies and Arms Length Bodies (ALBs).\n\nEach organisation was assigned an alphanumeric identifier, and the register also included website addresses, that could be mapped to entries in the GB-GOVUK identifier list."
