As laid down in article 12, Section 1, of the Social Welfare Act 2049, the international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) seeking to work in the Kingdom of Nepal must apply to the Social Welfare Council and seek permission prior to starting work.\" [1] \n\n[1] Document available for download at - http://www.swc.org.np/?page_id=47"
