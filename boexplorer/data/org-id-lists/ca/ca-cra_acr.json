In constructing an organisation identifier, only the first nine digits should be used. \n\nCompanies can be searched by using the Business Number, as assigned by the CRA, on this incomplete registry hosted by the Canadian govt - https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html?locale=en_CA\n\n## More detail:\n\nNot all companies need a Canadian Business Number.
