    "en": "Community Based Organisations (CBOs) operating in Jinja District in Uganda are required to register at the district level by the District NGO Monitoring Committee (DNMC) [1]. DNMC will issue a certificate of registration and a permit to the CBO. The certificate of registration will be issued once, while the permit is renewed annually. The certificate of registration contains a unique registration number that belongs to the CBO. There is no publicly available site to verify the ownership and validity of this number.\n\n[1] https://www.ngobureau.go.ug/en/services/community-based-organisations"
